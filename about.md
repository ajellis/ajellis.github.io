I recently graduated from The Iron Yard, a code school in Durham, NC. While attending the Iron Yard, I studied Ruby on Rails, and learned many different web development tools such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, JQuery. Since completing the Iron Yard, I have continued to improve as a Ruby on Rails developer, while also learning different languages like Perl. I am enjoying being a developer very much, and I want to use the knowledge and skills I have obtained to give back to the world.

If you want to collaborate on changing the world and impacting the lives of as many people as possible, you are very welcome to contact me. I would love to hear from you!
